# üìä Sales & Product Analysis SQL Project

## üìÅ Project Overview

This SQL project focuses on analyzing a retail/fmcg-style database involving customers, products, pricing, manufacturing, and sales. It uses **advanced SQL techniques** like CTEs, aggregations, joins, subqueries, and window functions to derive business insights from transactional and dimensional data.

### NOTE: I have also included Power BI visualization file named "atliq power bi.pdf", in which i have turned the insights and visually interepreted it using Power BI tool.

## üìÇ Dataset Tables

- `dim_customer`: Customer details including region, channel, and market.
- `dim_product`: Product metadata like segment and division.
- `fact_sales_monthly`: Monthly sales data (sold quantity, date).
- `fact_gross_price`: Product pricing data per fiscal year.
- `fact_manufacturing_cost`: Manufacturing cost per product.
- `fact_pre_invoice_deductions`: Discount information before invoicing.

## üîç Query Descriptions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Query: Market Identification
**Goal:** Identify which market "Atliq Exclusive" operates in within the world map.  
**SQL:** `SELECT DISTINCT market ...`

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Query: Product Count Growth
**Goal:** Compare the number of unique products sold in 2020 and 2021, and calculate the percentage change.  
**SQL:** CTEs for both years and a final calculation using arithmetic expressions.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Query: Product Count by Segment
**Goal:** Count the number of unique products per segment and rank them.  
**SQL:** `GROUP BY segment ORDER BY product_count DESC`

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Query: Year-over-Year Product Difference by Segment
**Goal:** Calculate the difference in unique products per segment from 2020 to 2021.  
**SQL:** Uses CTEs for both years and computes the difference.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Query: Manufacturing Cost Extremes
**Goal:** Find the products with the **highest and lowest** manufacturing costs.  
**SQL:** Subqueries to get `MAX()` and `MIN()`.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Query: Top Discounts in India (2021)
**Goal:** Identify top 5 customers in India who received the highest average pre-invoice discount in 2021.  
**SQL:** `AVG()`, `ROUND()`, `ORDER BY DESC LIMIT 5`

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Query: Gross Sales Over Time for Atliq Exclusive
**Goal:** Calculate the monthly gross sales amount for "Atliq Exclusive".  
**SQL:** Uses date formatting and multiple joins.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Query: Quarterly Sold Quantity (2020)
**Goal:** Show total quantity sold per quarter in 2020, ranked by quantity.  
**SQL:** Uses `QUARTER()` and `GROUP BY`.

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Query: Sales Contribution by Channel (2021)
**Goal:** Calculate gross sales by channel and their percentage contribution to total sales.  
**SQL:** CTEs for partial and total sales, with percentage calculation.

---

### üîü Query: Top Products by Division (2021)
**Goal:** Identify top 3 best-selling products in each division in 2021 using ranking.  
**SQL:** Uses `DENSE_RANK()` window function within CTE.
